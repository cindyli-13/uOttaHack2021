## Inspiration
The inspiration of this application stemmed from a discord video call, where the phrase “turn on your cameras, this is the only way we can see each other” changed from just a sentence into an idea.  

We wanted to create an app specifically created by and for university students, to create a virtually social environment that could aid in reigniting connection, excitement, and the feeling of taking new chances.

## What it does
- Helps university/college students interact and meet other students around the world, or in their own community
	- Includes features such as searching for a friend in a specific program or year
	- Features other channels created for different purposes such as studying together, chilling, playing games, networking, working out, and more
- Connects students in a 1-on-1 format or in a group environment
	- Integrates a video calling feature, allowing for the exchange of contact information and the ability to quickly make friends
	- Also allows for text messaging and video calling using an avatar in consideration for users’ privacy concerns 
- Helps maintain social activity and prevents COVID from affecting people's mental health

## How we built it
CampusCloud was built using Flutter and Dart. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Although we had many ambitious ideas that would have added to the experience of using our app, time was a big constraint as we had to learn to prioritize the most important features
- Implementing certain features proved to be a problem, so once again we had to learn to prioritize certain features and details 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We came up with a great Idea that can help a lot of students, including ourselves 
- We actively communicated and gave constructive feedback as a team, allowing for a realistic but enterprising product
- We were able to make a stellar, straightforward, and resourceful UI

## What we learned
- How to use different tools/browsers for UI/UX design applications & prototyping
	- Specifically, we learned how to make full use of flutter's imports and how to use an emulator to fully test out program 

## What's next for CampusCloud
- We want to be able to implement the other features/channels we couldn’t add this hackathon, including: 
	- Study, Games, Chill, Workout, Music channels 
	- Establishing a secure way to verify that users are students
	- Allowing users to share socials with a click of button
	- Creating a globe feature which allows students to see which countries they have virtually visited
	- Provide a history list of people they have spoken to
